I"£<p>This is my very first student-only publication which will appear in the proceedings of the 25th International Workshop on Approximation Algorithms for Combinatorial Optimization Problems (APPROX 2022) with co-author Vihan Shah from Rutgers University.</p>

<p>I am grateful for my co-author Vihan and all our in-depth discussions on this work and its presentation. Similarly, the stimulating discussions regarding this work with my supervisor, Christian Konrad, and Vihanâ€™s supervisor, Sepehr Assadi, were invaluable. Thank you!</p>

<h4 id="abstract">Abstract</h4>

<p>We optimally resolve the space complexity for the problem of finding an \textsf{$\alpha$-approximate minimum vertex cover} ($\alpha\textsf{MVC}$) in dynamic graph streams. We give a randomised algorithm for $\alpha\textsf{MVC}$ which uses $O(n^2/\alpha^2)$ bits of space matching Dark and Konradâ€™s lower bound [CCC~2020] up to constant factors.
By computing a random greedy matching, we identify â€˜easyâ€™ instances of the problem which can trivially be solved by returning the entire vertex set. The remaining â€˜hardâ€™ instances, then have sparse induced subgraphs which we exploit to get our space savings and solve $\alpha\textsf{MVC}$.</p>

<p>Achieving this type of optimality result is crucial for providing a complete understanding of a problem, and it has been gaining interest within the dynamic graph streaming community.
For connectivity, Nelson and Yu [SODA~2019] improved the lower bound showing that $\Omega(n \log^3 n)$ bits of space is necessary while Ahn, Guha, and McGregor [SODA~2012] have shown that $O(n \log^3 n)$ bits is sufficient. 
For finding an \textsf{$\alpha$-approximate maximum matching}, the upper bound was improved by Assadi and Shah [ITCS~2022] showing that $O(n^2/\alpha^3)$ bits is sufficient while Dark and Konrad [CCC~2020] have shown that $\Omega(n^2/\alpha^3)$ bits is necessary. The space complexity, however, remains unresolved for many other dynamic graph streaming problems where further improvements can still be made.</p>
