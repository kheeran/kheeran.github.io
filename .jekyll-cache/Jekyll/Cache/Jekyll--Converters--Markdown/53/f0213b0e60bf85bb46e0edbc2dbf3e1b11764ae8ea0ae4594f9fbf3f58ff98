<h4 id="abstract">Abstract</h4>
<p>In the semi-streaming model, proposed by Feigenbaum et al. [ICALP 2004], a graph with n vertices is presented to an algorithm as a stream of edges where the algorithm maintains a memory of size $O(n \textrm{ polylog } n)$. It provides an efficient model for processing massive graphs which have quickly become widespread.</p>

<p>Finding a maximum bipartite matching is a fundamental graph problem which has numerous real-world applications and has garnered great attention in this model. In this talk, I will cover the best known algorithms and lower bounds using two passes of the stream. This is based on joint work with Dr Christian Konrad.</p>
