This was an internal conference held for postgraduate research (PGR) students in the School of Computer Science, Electrical and Electronic Engineering, and Engineering Maths (SCEEM) to showcase their research. My talk was on the following:

#### {{ page.description }}
This talk was a general overview on matchings and the semi-streaming model of computation. It included the general approach for increasing the size of maximal matching via augmenting paths, briefly touching on the results of my work [On Two-Pass Streaming Algorithms for Maximum Bipartite Matching](/publication-On-Two-Pass-Streaming-Algorithms).
